## Introduction

When deciding to pursue an interest in capital markets, one of the consequent actions accompanying this pursuit is to navigate the financial regulations that govern
these markets. When comparing regulations in the US against those of other developed first rate nations, you'd be forgiven if your assessment suggested that the restrictions seem to imply that the regulatory bodies don't believe that the adult population is capable of undertaking their own investment decisions. 

CFD (Contract for Difference) trading is permissible
to the residents of comporable developed nations, that reside in the U.K., Japan, throughout the Eurozone, Switzerland, New Zealand, and Australia. These comporable 
economies also don't require you to have a minimum of $25,000 deposited in a brokerage account for you to be granted the privilege of purchasing and selling a security
on the same day more than 3 times a week. Though strangely, in the US you are permitted to walk into any casino to take out a loan secured by your mortgage to make a $25,000 investment on the possibility that a ball whirling around a roulette will land on the color black (*contradictory much*). 

Enough of my take on financial regulations, the primary objective here was to go through my latest personal project, which is related to capital trading so my spiel is somewhat applicable.

Those of us in the US researching crypto exchanges which offer derivitive products may have narrowed in on Bybit as a suitable candidate for our trading activities, since their KYC policies are more liberal compared to the other players in the space. They provide 2 separate platforms, one for U.S. residents and another for everyone else abroad. For those with a little technical know how, I'm sure you can figure out how to access the latter (*tip* there's a clue in the title of the post).

Using the method above pigeon holes you to their web app to make trades which is only made available in the desktop version of their platform, making usability a nightmare. Mobile VPN connections, in my experience can't be relied on to provide stable connections (*from my provider at least*) for long durations which causes the site the session to become invalid and ultimately creates an annoying loop of reconnecting to VPN server, inputing login details, fetching the multifactor code from Google Authenticator every time I want to place a trade when I'm away from the a desktop.

This project was started to resolve those annoyances.
